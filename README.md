# Paint Program

A program which allows the user to alter the colour of a grid of pixels with the aid of a "paint bucket" fill tool.

## How to Run

Download the file and / or run the code on your IDE of choice (Codeblocks or DevC++ should both work). The console should display an empty grid and the user's currently selected colour.

## How to Use

The cursor is moved with the arrow keys to select a pixel (the cursor covers up said pixel's colour). The "c" key is used to cycle through five available shades of white. The "d" key is used to set the selected pixel to the current colour. The "f" key acts as a fill tool where the enclosed shape of pixels of the same colour as the pixel selected is turned all one colour.
